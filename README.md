### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hey everyone! This is my Github and it contains all of my side projects that I have worked on! I am extremely interested in the engineering field and love to find out how every aspect of technology works. I am currently a first year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. My interests are in robotics, embedded-systems, machine-learning, computer vision libraries, web development, and mechatronics in general ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–

Feel free to check out all my socials and connect with me, love to meet new people!
