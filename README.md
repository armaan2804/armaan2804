### Welcome ğŸ‘‹

Hey everyone! This is my Github and it contains all of my side projects that I have worked on over the last year! I am extremely interested in the engineering field and love to find out how every aspect of technology works. I am currently a high school student at John Fraser Secondary School and am planning to pursue an engineering degree. My interests are in machine-learning, computer vision libraries, web development, mechatronics and RPA. ğŸ¤–ğŸ¤–ğŸ¤–ğŸ¤–

Feel free to check out all my socials and connect with me, love to meet new people!
